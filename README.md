# Random Password Generator

## Description
This application, the Random Password Generator, is a web application that specializes in creating secure and hard-to-guess passwords for use in any program requiring a password. The mock-up and HTML of this application was created using code provided by University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp. 

The purpose of this application is to generate stronger passwords for use throughout the internet. Stronger passwords are more random in nature and harder to guess by both other parties and hackers alike. The user can input certain criteria for their password including length and special characters. Once the criteria are set a password will be generated using those characters in a random order. Randomized passwords like this are hard to guess and therefore much more effective.

This project can be deployed [here][https://mrarcher2000.github.io/Random-Password-Generator/] or at https://mrarcher2000.github.io/Random-Password-Generator/.

## Installation

This application is web-based and does not need any installation onto the user's device. It is available for common user acces at https://mrarcher2000.github.io/Random-Password-Generator/. 

Developers may acces the project for further editing or review by accessing the repository at https://github.com/mrarcher2000/Random-Password-Generator/.

## Usage

The Random Password Generator is very easy to use. To begin, click on the button labeled 'Generate Password' and a series of prompts will appear asking what types of characters to use in the randomized password. The types of characters that are valid include:

    1. Lowercase Letters
    2. Uppercase Letters
    3. Numbers
    4. Special Characters (!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~)

The prompts will ask for the user to click either 'OK' or 'Cancel' for each type of character as well as how long to make the password. Once the user finishes the prompts that appear, a random password will be generated in the HTML block labeled "Your Secure Password". Upon clicking the button again, the prompts will reappear again and a new password will be generated in its place.
